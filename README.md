## Project Name
Semantic HTML project

## Description
In this project, I was expected to change non-semantic HTML tags to semantic tags and then fix the css so that the webpage doesn't change. 

## Usage
This project can be used as an example of how to use semantic tags.

## Contributing
At this time I will not be accepting contributions to this homework assignment.
The source code for this project came from EDX, UofM coding boot camp module 1.
